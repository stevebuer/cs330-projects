# Chat Transcript: DX Band Openness LSTM Model Integration

**Date:** October 31, 2025

---

This transcript documents the step-by-step process of building, training, and integrating an LSTM model for DX band openness prediction into a Streamlit dashboard.

## Key Steps
- Discussed project goals and data requirements
- Extracted and summarized daily DX spot data
- Created labeled example data for LSTM training
- Built and tested an LSTM model for band openness prediction
- Moved model files to a dedicated directory
- Installed required packages (TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
- Ran and validated the model
- Integrated the model into the Streamlit dashboard (AI Model page)
- Discussed performance and deployment considerations

## Next Actions
- Deploy and test the Streamlit dashboard
- Continue improving data quality and model accuracy
- Save/load trained models for faster inference
