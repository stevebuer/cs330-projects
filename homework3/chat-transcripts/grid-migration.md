# Grid Squares Migration - Chat Transcript

## Overview
Added functionality to store source and destination Maidenhead grid square locators for DX cluster spots that contain this information.

## Database Changes

### Migration: 001_add_grid_squares_table.sql
Created a new table `spot_grid_squares` with the following structure:
- `id`: Primary key (SERIAL)
- `dx_spot_id`: Foreign key to `dx_spots.id` (with CASCADE delete)
- `source_grid`: Spotter's grid locator (VARCHAR(6))
- `dest_grid`: DX station's grid locator (VARCHAR(6))
- `created_at`: Timestamp (default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- Unique constraint on `dx_spot_id` (one entry per spot)
- Indices on `dx_spot_id`, `source_grid`, and `dest_grid`

### Migration Runner
Created `run_migrations.py` to execute SQL migration files in order.

## Code Changes

### Enhanced DX Cluster Scraper (`scrapers/dx_cluster_live_pg.py`)

#### Grid Square Parsing
- Modified `parse_dx_spot_line()` to extract ALL Maidenhead grid locators from comments
- Uses regex pattern `\b[A-R]{2}\d{2}[a-x]{2}?\b` to find 4-6 character grid squares
- Assigns first grid found to DX station (`dx_grid`)
- Assigns second grid found to spotter (`spotter_grid`)
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `grid_square` field

#### Database Storage
- Modified `store_spot()` to return `dx_spot_id` after inserting into `dx_spots`
- Added logic to insert into `spot_grid_squares` when both grids are available
- Includes proper error handling for grid square insertions

#### Enhanced Logging
- Updated console output to display grid square pairs when available
- Format: `[SOURCE_GRID->DEST_GRID]` (e.g., `[EM12->FN42]`)

## Usage

1. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   cd homework3/database
   python run_migrations.py
   ```

2. Run the DX cluster scraper as usual - it will automatically populate grid squares when both are present in spot comments.

## Benefits
- Captures valuable propagation path data
- Enables distance and bearing calculations between stations
- Supports advanced DX analysis and visualization
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data
