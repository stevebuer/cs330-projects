## 1. Git Commit Check and Push

**User Request**: Check git status and ensure everything is committed for the assignment due tomorrow.

**Actions Taken**:
- Checked git status - found modified README.md file
- Staged the changes with `git add homework3/README.md`
- Committed with message: "Update homework3 README with progress on LSTM model, SQL study, and deployment"
- Verified working tree clean
- Pushed commits to GitHub (2 commits ahead of origin/main)

**Result**: ✅ All files successfully committed and pushed to remote

---

## 2. Docker Files Organization

**User Request**: Move Docker-related files from homework3 root into a subfolder to reduce clutter.

**Docker Files Moved to `docker/` subfolder**:
- `Dockerfile.api`
- `Dockerfile.streamlit`
- `Dockerfile.web`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker-compose.production.yml`
- `docker-compose.production.simple.yml`
- `docker-manage.sh`
- `.dockerignore`
- `.env.docker`

**Files Updated**:
- `README.md` - Updated all file paths and usage instructions to reference `docker/` directory
  - Changed `./docker-manage.sh` → `cd docker && ./docker-manage.sh`
  - Updated Dockerfile references to `docker/Dockerfile.*`
  - Updated docker-compose paths to `docker/docker-compose*.yml`

**Result**: ✅ Successfully reorganized with updated documentation

**Commit**: "Organize Docker files into docker/ subdirectory"

## 3. Simple RNN Model Creation

**User Request**: Create a basic RNN model to compare with existing LSTM model for learning purposes.

### New Directory: `rnn-model/`

**Files Created**:
1. **`rnn_train_example.py`** (240 lines)
   - SimpleRNN implementation using TensorFlow/Keras
   - Uses same data format as LSTM for easy comparison
   - Architecture:
     - SimpleRNN(32) with relu activation
     - Dense(16) with relu activation
     - Dense(1) with sigmoid for binary classification
   - Features detailed console output with progress indicators
   - Saves trained model as `rnn_model.h5`
   - 30 epochs training with batch size 2

2. **`example_rnn_dx_spot_data.csv`**
   - 15 records of daily DX spot summary data
   - Same schema as LSTM training data
   - Features: total_spots, unique_dx_stations, unique_spotters, spots_10m, spots_12m, spots_15m, spots_10m_fm
   - Labels: band_open_10m, band_open_12m, band_open_15m (1=open, 0=closed)

3. **`README.md`** (comprehensive guide)
   - Explains RNN vs LSTM differences
   - Comparison table showing architecture, parameters, training speed, capabilities
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Model architecture diagram
   - Data format documentation
   - Hyperparameter tuning suggestions
   - References to learning resources

### Comparison Script: `compare_models.py`

- Root level script in homework3 directory
- Trains both RNN and LSTM models on same data
- Displays side-by-side performance comparison including:
  - Model parameters count
  - Training time
  - Test accuracy and loss
  - Training/validation metrics
- Provides analysis of tradeoffs
- Helpful for learning model architecture differences

**Key RNN vs LSTM Differences Documented**:
| Aspect | SimpleRNN | LSTM |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Architecture | Basic cells with hidden state | Memory cells with gates |
| Parameters | Fewer (~3x fewer) | More |
| Vanishing Gradient | Prone | Resistant |
| Training Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Long-term Dependencies | Weaker | Stronger |
| Complexity | Simpler | More complex |

**Result**: ✅ Complete RNN implementation with documentation and comparison tools

**Commit**: "Add Simple RNN model for comparison with LSTM"

## 4. Final Git Push

**Remaining Actions**:
- All changes staged and committed
- Pushed to GitHub remote
- Working tree clean

**Summary of Changes**:
1. Docker reorganization (9 files moved, 1 file updated)
2. RNN model implementation (4 new files)
3. Comparison script (1 new file)

**Total Commits in Session**: 3
- Update homework3 README with progress on LSTM model, SQL study, and deployment
- Organize Docker files into docker/ subdirectory
- Add Simple RNN model for comparison with LSTM

## Learning Outcomes

This session established a framework for:
1. **Infrastructure Organization** - Cleaner directory structure
2. **ML Model Learning** - Direct comparison between RNN and LSTM architectures
3. **Experiment Environment** - Side-by-side training and evaluation
4. **Documentation** - Clear guides for future reference

## Next Steps Mentioned

- User planning to create Terraform infrastructure for:
  - Vultr cloud environment (production)
  - Virtualbox testing environment
  - Latest Debian OS for both
