## Sentiment Analysis Script Modification

**User**: change this script to read the sentiment text from the command line.

**Assistant**: Modified the `hf_simple.py` script to accept command-line arguments using Python's `argparse` module. The changes included:
- Added command-line argument parsing
- Created a `main()` function
- Updated the script to use the provided text argument
- Maintained the core sentiment analysis functionality

## Gemma Model Implementation

**User**: make a copy of this program and use it to call a small version of the gemma model.

**Assistant**: Created a new file `gemma_simple.py` based on the sentiment analysis script with the following changes:
- Used the Gemma 2B model (google/gemma-2b)
- Added proper tokenizer and model initialization
- Configured text generation pipeline with parameters:
  - max_length: 100
  - temperature: 0.7
- Updated command-line argument handling for text generation prompts
- Added notes about package requirements and model license acceptance

Both scripts remain in the homework1 directory and can be used independently.
