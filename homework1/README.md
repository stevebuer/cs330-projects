## Project Planning 

My favorite hobby is ham radio. I would like to develop an AI model to predict worldwide high frequency (HF) radio propagation. 
Traditional HF propagation programs have relied on solar data for their predictions. For example, the popular W6ELprop program
uses something called the Solar Terrestrial Dispatch (STL) model. I would like to take a difference approach based on the observation
that certain propagation trends tend to persist for a period of time. It is not guaranteed that propagation at 28 Mhz will be good tomorrow
because it was good today, but it probably will. I think these types of probabilistic radio phenomena may be well-suited to prediction
by a machine learning model. I would like to explore this possibiliy in my project.
