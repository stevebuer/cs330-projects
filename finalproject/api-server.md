# API Server

The API server is implemented with Flask/CORS and deployed as a docker container.

The API is documented using the [openapi format](api-docs/openapi.yaml)

A generated [markdown document](api-docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md) is available as well.

An [HTML data browser](http://api.jxqz.org:8080) is available at the root level for simple queries and data exports.
