# CS330 Homework 2 - Two Week Development Summary

## **Infrastructure & Production Deployment**
• **DNS & Web Server Configuration** - Set up dx.jxqz.org domain with Apache2 virtual host configuration for production deployment
• **PostgreSQL Production Setup** - Installed and configured PostgreSQL server with proper user roles, permissions, and database schema migration
• **Linux Service Integration** - Created systemd service for DX cluster scraper with automatic restart, logging, and boot integration

## **Application Architecture & Development**
• **Real-time DX Cluster Monitoring** - Developed fault-tolerant scraper with error handling, replacing deprecated telnetlib with socket-based implementation
• **REST API Development** - Built comprehensive JSON REST API with 8+ endpoints for DX spot data, statistics, and real-time monitoring
• **Web Dashboard Creation** - Implemented Dash-based monitoring dashboard with real-time statistics and data visualization
• **Service Separation** - Refactored architecture to separate scraper service from web UI for better maintainability and reliability

## **Packaging & Deployment Solutions**
• **Debian Package Creation** - Built professional .deb packages for database and scraper components with proper dependencies and installation scripts
• **Docker Containerization** - Created Docker containers for API and web services with Docker Compose orchestration and Traefik reverse proxy
• **Multi-Environment Deployment** - Solved Docker Compose version compatibility issues between development and production environments

## **Development & DevOps Tools**
• **Comprehensive Documentation** - Created API documentation, deployment guides, and service management documentation

• **Testing & Debugging Infrastructure** - Set up local testing environment with Apache/mod_wsgi integration

## **Database & Data Management**
• **Schema Design & Migration** - Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL with proper indexing and performance optimization  
• **Real-time Data Pipeline** - Implemented continuous data collection from live DX cluster networks with proper error handling
• **Data Analytics Features** - Added band activity analysis, frequency histograms, and top callsign tracking

## **Professional Development Practices**
• **Version Control & Documentation** - Maintained detailed chat transcripts, configuration management, and deployment procedures
• **Security Implementation** - Configured proper database roles, user permissions, and production security practices
• **Monitoring & Logging** - Implemented comprehensive logging, health checks, and service monitoring capabilities
