If you're building a website styled like a monitoring dashboard, here are some of the best UI toolkits and frameworks tailored for that purpose:
üß∞ Top UI Toolkits for Monitoring Dashboards
Toolkit	Best For	Key Features
Grafana	Real-time system monitoring	Rich visualizations, alerting, plugin ecosystem, supports many data sources
MetricFire	Hosted Grafana dashboards	No setup required, integrates with Prometheus & Graphite, team collaboration
Dashbuilder	Lightweight, customizable dashboards	Multiple data sources, flexible layouts, easy deployment
Freeboard	IoT and real-time data visualization	Simple UI, fast setup, ideal for lightweight use cases
Moza√Øk	Wall displays and modular dashboards	Grid-based layout, widget system, good for status boards
Re:Dash	Analytics and SQL-based dashboards	Query builder, data exploration, suited for BI teams
Kibana	Log data and Elasticsearch integration	Powerful log visualization, filtering, and search
Smashing	Custom wall dashboards	Ruby-based, great for office displays and status boards
üß† How to Choose the Right One

    Data Type: Are you visualizing metrics, logs, or APIs?

    Audience: Developers, business users, or operations teams?

    Setup Effort: Do you want plug-and-play or full customization?

If you're looking for something with minimal setup and strong visual appeal, MetricFire or Grafana are excellent starting points. For more niche or display-focused dashboards, Moza√Øk or Smashing might be ideal.
