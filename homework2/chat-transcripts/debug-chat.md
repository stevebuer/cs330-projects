# Web UI Debug Session Chat Transcript

## Initial Setup and Troubleshooting

**User:** Can you help me run this app locally for testing?

**Assistant:** Started helping with local setup:

1. Configured Python Environment:
```bash
Environment Type: VirtualEnvironment
Version: 3.11.2.final.0
Command Prefix: /home/steve/GITHUB/cs330-projects/.venv/bin/python
```

2. Installed Dependencies:
- Installed requirements from `requirements-web.txt`
- Fixed numpy/pandas compatibility issue by reinstalling specific versions:
  ```bash
  numpy==1.24.3
  pandas==2.0.3
  ```

## Database Configuration Issues

1. **PostgreSQL User Issue**
```
Error: connection to server failed: FATAL: role "steve" does not exist
```
- Created necessary database roles using `setup_db_roles.sql`
- Set up roles: dx_readonly, dx_writer, dx_web_user, dx_scraper

2. **Database Schema Issue**
```
Error: permission denied for schema public
LINE 2: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS raw_spots
```
- Had to run schema creation as postgres user
- Successfully created tables:
  - raw_spots
  - dx_spots
  - callsigns
  - Created necessary indexes

3. **Schema Mismatch**
Final error encountered:
```
Error: column "spot_time" does not exist
LINE 6: MAX(spot_time) as last_spot_time
```
- Need to update queries to match schema (timestamp instead of spot_time)

## Environment Setup Progress

1. Created and configured `.env` file:
```
PGDATABASE=dxcluster
PGUSER=dx_web_user
PGPASSWORD=web_user_password_here
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
```

2. Created log file:
```bash
sudo touch /var/log/dx_scraper.log
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/log/dx_scraper.log
```

## Next Steps Identified

1. Fix SQL queries to match schema (timestamp instead of spot_time)
2. Implement scraper control functionality
3. Add more visualizations
4. Set up production deployment with Apache

## Command History and Environment

- Working Directory: `/home/steve/GITHUB/cs330-projects/homework2`
- Python Environment: `.venv` in project root
- Database: PostgreSQL with custom roles and permissions
