# Chat Transcript: Scraper Service Refactor

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Topic:** Removing scraper control from web app and implementing systemctl service management

## Summary

The user requested to remove the scraper control functionality from the Dash web application and implement it as a proper systemctl service instead. This conversation covered refactoring the web app and creating service management tools.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Web Application Refactor (`homework2/web/app.py`)

**Removed Components:**
- Scraper control buttons (Start/Stop)
- Scraper status display
- Log viewer
- Scraper error messages
- All related callback functions

**Enhanced Features:**
- Expanded statistics display to 4 columns: Total spots today, active stations, latest update, total records
- Added 24-hour and 7-day statistics breakdown
- Improved layout with better spacing
- Enhanced error handling with graceful fallback to demo data
- Removed dependency on `scraper_control.py` module

**Technical Changes:**
- Removed imports: `State`, `callback_context`, `scraper_manager`
- Updated callback to return 7 outputs instead of 4
- Added new database queries for total records and extended statistics
- Simplified layout structure

### 2. Systemd Service Configuration (`homework2/dx-scraper.service`)

**Created systemd service file with:**
- Service runs as user `steve`
- Automatic restart on failure (`Restart=always`)
- 10-second restart delay (`RestartSec=10`)
- Dependency on PostgreSQL service
- Environment file loading from `.env`
- Proper working directory and Python virtual environment path
- Centralized logging through systemd journal

### 3. Service Management Script (`homework2/manage-scraper.sh`)

**Created comprehensive management script with commands:**
- `install` - Install service to systemd
- `uninstall` - Remove service from systemd
- `start/stop/restart` - Basic service control
- `status` - Show service status
- `logs` - View recent service logs
- `enable/disable` - Boot-time service management

**Features:**
- Error checking and validation
- Sudo privilege handling
- Clear usage instructions
- Proper cleanup on uninstall

### 4. Documentation (`homework2/SCRAPER_SERVICE_GUIDE.md`)

**Created comprehensive guide covering:**
- Installation instructions
- Service management commands
- Configuration details
- Monitoring and troubleshooting
- Benefits of the new architecture
- Database configuration requirements

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **Web App:** Pure data visualization and monitoring
- **Service:** Dedicated data collection with proper service management

### Professional Service Management
- Standard Linux service controls through systemctl
- Automatic recovery from failures
- System boot integration
- Centralized logging
- Better resource management

### Improved Reliability
- Independent operation of components
- Better error isolation
- Graceful degradation when database unavailable

## Technical Decisions

1. **Service User:** Runs as `steve` user for proper file permissions
2. **Restart Policy:** Automatic restart with 10-second delay prevents rapid failure loops
3. **Dependencies:** Waits for PostgreSQL to be available before starting
4. **Environment:** Loads from `.env` file for configuration consistency
5. **Logging:** Uses systemd journal for centralized log management

## Implementation Notes

- Web app now shows demo data when database is unavailable
- Service management script provides user-friendly interface to systemctl
- All scraper control logic removed from web interface
- Database queries optimized for the new statistics display
- Error handling improved throughout the application

## Next Steps Discussed

1. Install the service using `./manage-scraper.sh install`
2. Start the scraper service
3. Optionally enable auto-start on boot
4. Monitor through systemctl and journalctl commands

## Files Modified/Created

- `homework2/web/app.py` (modified - removed scraper controls, enhanced stats)
- `homework2/dx-scraper.service` (created - systemd service file)
- `homework2/manage-scraper.sh` (created - service management script)
- `homework2/SCRAPER_SERVICE_GUIDE.md` (created - documentation)

## Testing Notes

- Web application successfully starts at `http://localhost:8050`
- Database connection errors are handled gracefully with demo data
- Service file created with proper systemd configuration
- Management script made executable with proper permissions

This refactor successfully separates the data collection service from the web visualization interface, providing a more professional and maintainable architecture.
