# CS330 Homework 2 Project Development

My goal in this iteration is to move the project from a proof-of-concept/prototype stage to a pre-alpha working system deployed into a production environment.

## Initial list of features for this iteration

These are the list of features or goals that I have considered for implementing. I will preserve this to-do list here and then document the work in a section below.
Anything remaining will need to be pushed to the next iteration or re-factored.

* Configure DNS with server name: dx.jxqz.org
* Configure Apache Web Server to support this virtual host.
* Install Postgres server into production environment and configure users and access control.
* Migrate (or create) database schema for Postgres.
* Rewrite the dx cluster scraping program to have:
   * Fault tolerance and error handling
   * Stop, Start, Status Control interface for the web API to hook to
   * Logging of status error conditions to syslog or similar
   * Options for: raw storage of data to text file or database insert
   * Packaging and Deployment mechanism
* Initial pass of a Web UI control panel in the style of a monitoring dashboard (for now)
* Updated Schema Documentaion
* Chat Logs and the Usual
* SQL quick reference and study guide
* Consider a deployment strategy: packages, containers, etc?
* CI/CD pipline and automated testing?

## Development Tasks

### DNS Configuration

A CNAME record for dx.jxqz.org was added to my DNS configuration in my [domain registrar](www.porkbun.) portal.

### Configure Apache virtual server

I have an existing Linux virtual machine that runs my website. I [asked Copilot](chat-transcripts/apache2-chat.md) to create
an [Apache2](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4) config file [dx.jxqz.org.conf](config/dx.jxqz.org.conf) to create another virtual 
server for this project. I followed the instructions listed in the [chat transcript](chat-transcripts/apache2-chat.md) to manually
install the file and restart the server. Tested. The site dx.jxqz.org loads successfully with an empty directory listing.

### Postgresql production install and config

Used *sudo apt install postgresql* to install postgres on the production server.

I [asked Copilot](chat-transcripts/db-roles.md) to help me move the postgres version of my scripts to the curreny directory and create roles for the various programs that will connect to the RDBMS server.

### UI

I chatted with copilot and asked about the best UI frameworks for data science type projects.

Sure! Here's the message just before your question about copying the chat:

**Given your preferencesâ€”Python-based, no notebooks, real-time data, and predictive AI modelsâ€”here are the top UI frameworks that best suit your needs:**

### âš¡ Best Python UI Frameworks for Real-Time AI Dashboards

| Framework     | Strengths for Your Use Case                                      | Ideal For                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Dash**      | Highly customizable, supports real-time updates, integrates well with Plotly and Flask | Production-grade dashboards with complex UI    |
| **Streamlit** | Fast prototyping, simple syntax, supports real-time widgets and model outputs | Lightweight apps and quick deployment          |
| **Panel**     | Flexible layout, supports multiple plotting libraries, good for streaming data | Multi-visual dashboards with PyData stack      |
| **Reflex**    | React-powered Python framework, great for dynamic UIs and state management | Modern, reactive apps with real-time interactivity |
| **Gradio**    | Ideal for ML model demos, supports live inputs and outputs       | Sharing AI models with interactive interfaces  |

### ðŸ§  Recommendation Based on Your Needs
- **For real-time predictive AI models**: **Dash** and **Reflex** offer the most control and scalability. Dash is mature and enterprise-ready, while Reflex is newer but React-powered for dynamic UIs.
- **For simplicity and speed**: **Streamlit** is excellent if you want to get up and running quickly with minimal code.
- **For multi-library support**: **Panel** is great if you're using tools like Bokeh, Matplotlib, or Holoviews.

Would you like help scaffolding a starter dashboard with one of these frameworks?
